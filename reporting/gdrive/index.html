    <h1>Google Drive Privacy Risk</h1>
    <p>
        This security / privacy risk is more user error then anything.
        <br> it relies on google drive allowing you to search for any
        <br> document shared to you either by accident or on purpose
        <br> by the whole district. You can easily see this by going
        <br> google drive and searching <i><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=source:domain">source:domain</a></i>
        <br>
        <br> This exposes alot of documents, some which were clearly
        <br> not meant to be shared to the whole district from
        <br> students and teachers.
        <br>
        <br> The only real way to mitigate would just to inform
        <br> staff/students about the implications of sharing
        <br> and to ensure they arent selecting the option
        <br> of sharing to everyone in the district.
        <br>
