        <h1>Google Drive Privacy Risk</h1>
        <p>
            This security / privacy risk is more user error then anything.
            it relies on google drive allowing you to search for any
            document shared to you either by accident or on purpose
            by the whole district. You can easily see this by going
            google drive and searching <i><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=source:domain">source:domain</a></i>
            <br><br>
            This exposes alot of documents, some which were clearly
            not meant to be shared to the whole district from
            students and teachers.
            <br><br>
            The only real way to mitigate would just to inform
            staff/students about the implications of sharing
            and to ensure they arent selecting the option
            of sharing to everyone in the district.
