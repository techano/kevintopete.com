    <h1>Bookmarlet information</h1>
    <p>
        Bookmarklets are pieces of javascript that are ran as a bookmark,
        <br> the main way to fix this type of bypass is to take the following
        <br> steps on the districts Google Admin Console:
        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to Google Admin Console</li>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/chrome/settings/user">Devices > Chrome > Settings</a>.</li>
            <li>Select the OU group the students are in on the left</li>
            <li>Scroll to <b>URL blocking</b>.</li>
            <li>Add the line <i>javascript://*</i></li>
        </ol>

        The blocking information was sourced from: <a href="https://xfanatical.com/blog/block-student-bookmarklets">Xfanatical</a>
        <br>
        <br> Some popular bookmarklets are below. These are hosted on 
        <br> this site for the use of reporting them and will not be
        <br> shared. To use these bookmarklets, drag them to your 
        <br> bookmarks and follow the instructions next to them.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="javascript:function confirmbox(){confirm('This script is only meant to be used for reporting purposes to Gilbert Public Schools, not for student use. Click OK to continue running script. This will work on any site.')?(document.body.contentEditable='true',document.designMode='on',window.alert('Script has been run. Click anywhere to edit text')):window.alert('Script Terminated')}confirmbox();">Enable page editing</a>, to use drag it to your bookmarks and click on it on any page.
                This will enable creation mode on the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> another very popular one is one that allows you to disable
        <br> any extension on the browser including GoGuardian. The 
        <br> instructions for this are a bit different. You want to
        <br> right click on bookmark bar, add page and then for the
        <br> page url you want to paste in the following javascript
        <br> code <a href="https://kevintopete.com/reporting/bookmarklets/js/disable_extensions_minified.js"><i>click here to view code</i></a> once you have done that
        <br> you then browse to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions"><i>chrome webstore</i></a> and then you
        <br> click the bookmark you created with the added code.
        <br>
        <br> The disable extensions bookmarklet is especially dangerous as it 
        <br> allows disabling of Goguardian and the other filtering plugins. 
        <br> This particular bookmarlet is already being looked at by 
        <br> Goguardian and Google respectively.
        <br>
